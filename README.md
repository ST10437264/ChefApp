Changelog for MAST5112 PORTFOLIO OF EVIDENCE  

The improvements made from Part 2 of the assignment is I tried minimizing the chances of bug and errors. In this Portfolio of Evidence,
I have added new features as required from the assessment document. In Part 2, the Chef app only had 1 screen where the chef had to enter a 
new menu item, choose where it is going to be saved. Problems / Challenges that I have faced during the implementation of the requirements 
for this final submission, is the navigation between the screens. When I have to install the functionality the app glitches or it does not 
install at all, or it just duplicates my files.  

Now in Part 3, what was requested was to have 3 screens. The first screen is where the user / chef is going to see the menu which involves
Starters, Main and Dessert course menu items. When you have scrolled to the bottom of the app you will see two buttons which are: Add new item 
and Filter by course. When the user / chef has clicked the Add new Item button, it will take them to the Add Items Screen. In this screen the 
chef will enter the title of the dish, description of the dish and the price of the dish, once done they will then choose where they want the 
dish / menu item added and proceed to click the save button.  It was also required for the menu list in the home screen to have an average amount
of each course presented, which I have added, and it has been giving me problems for a while but in the end, I have successfully implemented what
was required.  

Right beneath the Save button is where the menu items of the selected course that has been chosen to have new menu items, will also have the existing
menu items of that course that the chef can remove from the menu that is displayed in the home screen. After saving the new menu item, it will lead the
chef back to the home page/ screen. Here, they can click the Filter by course button. With the Filter by course button clicked, the user / chef will find 
three buttons which are: View Starters, View Main, View Desserts. By clicking any of these buttons, the user/ chef will be led to the full menu items of that
course chosen.   

As to the feedback given by the lecture, I have tried to fix the problems that have been stated. It was stated that my buttons in the app were too close to
each other therefore in this app the buttons have more spaces between them.  I have also tried to have more descriptive commit messages but the mix up of the
assignments (MAST5112 poe – part 2 and this current assignment) some of my work was lost and I had to create an entirely new GitHub repository for this assignment’s 
submission.  As for my video presenting the app working with a voiceover explaining how the app works, for the part 2 submission there was no voiceover and for this 
one as well there will be no voiceover. The reason for this is because my laptop’s microphone does not work / give clear sound, so I have decided to submit the video
without a voiceover. Hope the Lecture will understand the problem I am facing.
